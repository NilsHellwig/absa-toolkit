I am getting to really enjoy Turkish Airlines, as DATE I had two legs on TK.####[('Turkish Airlines', 'airline general', 'positive', 'enjoy')]
Best airways for elderly people.####[('airways', 'airline general', 'positive', 'Best')]
By far, the worst seats I have experienced in DATE.####[('seats', 'onboard seat comfort', 'negative', 'worst')]
If you just flying business this short leg, than it's not worth paying the extra for business class.####[('business class', 'airline price', 'negative', 'not worth paying')]
First of all the crew kept speaking french to everyone even though you told them that you dont speak french (although this might be a general trend under the french).####[('crew', 'airline service', 'negative', 'kept speaking french to everyone even though you told them that you dont speak french')]
Delay of 4 hours in Istanbul - luckily we were able to use their business class lounge.####[('NULL', 'punctuality general', 'negative', 'Delay of 4 hours')]
After reading the reviews, I was a bit doubtful about this flight.####[('flight', 'airline general', 'negative', 'doubtful')]
Utterly poor experience.####[('NULL', 'airline general', 'negative', 'poor')]
It was 2 hours late.####[('NULL', 'punctuality general', 'negative', '2 hours late')]
Once on the plane the flight crew were excellent and very accommodating throughout the flight.####[('flight crew', 'airline service', 'positive', 'excellent'), ('flight crew', 'airline service', 'positive', 'accommodating')]
