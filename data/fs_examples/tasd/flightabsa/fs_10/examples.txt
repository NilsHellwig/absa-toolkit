I am getting to really enjoy Turkish Airlines, as DATE I had two legs on TK.####[['Turkish Airlines', 'airline general', 'positive']]
Best airways for elderly people.####[['airways', 'airline general', 'positive']]
By far, the worst seats I have experienced in DATE.####[['seats', 'onboard seat comfort', 'negative']]
If you just flying business this short leg, than it's not worth paying the extra for business class.####[['business class', 'airline price', 'negative']]
First of all the crew kept speaking french to everyone even though you told them that you dont speak french (although this might be a general trend under the french).####[['crew', 'airline service', 'negative']]
Delay of 4 hours in Istanbul - luckily we were able to use their business class lounge.####[['NULL', 'punctuality general', 'negative']]
After reading the reviews, I was a bit doubtful about this flight.####[['flight', 'airline general', 'negative']]
Utterly poor experience.####[['NULL', 'airline general', 'negative']]
It was 2 hours late.####[['NULL', 'punctuality general', 'negative']]
Once on the plane the flight crew were excellent and very accommodating throughout the flight.####[['flight crew', 'airline service', 'positive']]
